# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`nit` is a CLI for running parallel git operations across many repositories. The project explores different implementation approaches by building the same tool in multiple languages (Rust, Zig, and Crystal).

## Core Behavior

* **Basic mode**: wraps `git` and runs it for all sub-repos (depth 1) with args passed through
* **Optimized commands** (`pull`, `fetch`, `status`): run in parallel with condensed single-line output per repo
* **Pass-through**: any unrecognized command/args go directly to `git`

## Project Structure

```
./nit-rust/      # Rust implementation
./nit-zig/       # Zig implementation
./nit-crystal/   # Crystal implementation
./bin/           # Wrapper scripts (nit-rust, nit-zig, nit-crystal)
./script/        # Build, test, and benchmarking scripts
```

All binaries should be runnable via `./bin/nit-<language>`.

## Scripts

* `script/build` - Build implementations (optimized by default)
* `script/install` - Build and install to `~/.local/bin`
* `script/test` - Run tests
* `script/bench` - Run benchmarks with hyperfine

Run any script with `--help` for options.

## Development Tools

* `mise` for tool/dependency management
* `hyperfine` for benchmarking

## Key Implementation Details

### Dry-run mode
Dry-run output must be generated as close to actual execution as possible (same code path that builds the real command). Never construct dry-run output separately from real execution logic.

### Git execution
Use `git -C <repo-path>` for directory switching. Research and benchmark against `--git-dir` for performance.

### Parallel execution
Spawn all git processes immediately (non-blocking), then collect results. This maximizes parallelism by letting the OS handle process scheduling rather than limiting to a thread pool.

## Global CLI Options

```
--dry-run          Print exact commands without executing
--ssh              Force SSH URLs for remotes
--https            Force HTTPS URLs for remotes
-n, --workers N    Number of parallel workers (default: 8)
```
